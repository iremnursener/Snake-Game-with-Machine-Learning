# Snake-Game-with-Machine-Learning
In this project, the goal is for an agent to play the classic Snake game using reinforcement learning. In this study, the agent acts as a snake and collects food in the game area. Each time the agent collects food, it grows and optimizes itself to collect more food in the game area.
